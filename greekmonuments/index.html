        <div class="delphi-description">
            <p>Delphi (/ˈdɛlfaɪ, ˈdɛlfi/; Greek: Δελφοί [ðelˈfi]),[a] in legend previously called Pytho (Πυθώ), 
                in ancient times was a sacred precinct that served as the seat of Pythia, the major oracle who 
                was consulted about important decisions throughout the ancient classical world. The oracle was 
                international in character and also fostered sentiments of Greek nationality, even though the 
                nation of Greece was centuries away from realization. The ancient Greeks considered the centre 
                of the world to be in Delphi, marked by the stone monument known as the omphalos (navel).

            <p>The Tholos of Delphi is among the ancient structures of the Sanctuary of Athena Pronaia. 
                It is dated between 380 and 370 BC.

            <p>The Pythian priestess emerged preeminent by the end of the 7th century BC and continued to be 
                consulted until the late 4th century AD.[8] During this period, the Delphic Oracle was the most 
                prestigious and authoritative oracle among the Greeks, and she was among the most powerful women 
                of the classical world. The oracle is one of the best-documented religious institutions of the 
                classical Greeks.
